        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients (for 4 Servings)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of grated Georgian cheese (sulguni or imeruli)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>butter, to pat on top</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine lukewarm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. 
                Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.</li>

            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. 
                Gradually pour in the yeast mixture while stirring. 
                Mix until the dough starts to come together.</li>

            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 8-10 minutes 
                until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball and place it 
                in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and 
                let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
                In a separate bowl, combine the grated cheese and melted butter. 
                Mix well until the cheese is coated with butter. </li>

            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. 
                Divide the dough into 4 equal portions.</li>

            <li>Take one portion of the dough and roll it into an oval shape, approximately 1/4 inch thick. 
                Leave the edges slightly thicker than the center.</li>

            <li>Put the rolled dough onto the prepared baking sheet. 
                Spoon a 1/4th of the cheese mixture into the center of the dough, 
                leaving a border around the edges.</li>

            <li>Fold the edges of the dough over the cheese mixture, 
                partially covering it and forming a boat-like shape. Pinch the edges. 
                <em>Repeat steps 6-8 for 3 more times.</em></li>

            <li>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes. 
                Put an egg and place it on each of the pastries at 8-12 minutes's mark (on your preference).</li>

            <li>Remove the khachapuri from the oven, put an piece of butter on top 
                and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>

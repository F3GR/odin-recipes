        <h3>Ingredients (for 2 Servings)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>1.5 pounds of ground meat (pork, beef, or a mixture)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (such as parsley or cilantro), finely chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour and salt. 
                Gradually add the lukewarm water while mixing with your hands or a wooden spoon 
                until the dough comes together.</li>

            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes 
                until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball, 
                cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. 
                In another mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, 
                minced garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper (if using), 
                and fresh herbs (if desired). Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>

            <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into smaller portions and 
                roll each portion into a thin circle, about 4-5 inches (10-12 cm) in diameter. 
                Make sure to keep the remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying out.</li>

            <li>Take one dough circle and place about 1-2 tablespoons of the meat filling in the center. 
                Be careful not to overfill it, as it can make sealing the dumpling difficult.</li>

            <li>Lift the edges of the dough circle and start pleating them together, 
                creating small twists or knots. Pinch the pleats firmly to seal the dumpling, 
                leaving a small opening at the top.</li>

            <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough circles and filling 
                until you have made all the khinkali.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the khinkali 
                into the boiling water and cook them for about 8-10 minutes 
                or until they float to the surface.</li>

            <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked khinkali 
                to a serving platter or individual plates.</li>

            <li>Serve the khinkali hot, placing them on a large dish lined with a clean cloth napkin.
                You can also serve khinkali with a side of sour cream and a ground black pepper or a spicy sauce.
                Enjoy the meal!

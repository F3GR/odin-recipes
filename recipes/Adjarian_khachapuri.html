    <h1>Adjarian khachapuri</h1>
    <p>It is <strong>one of the most popular</strong> types of Georgian khachapuri 
        that originated in the Adjara region of Georgia. 
        It is <em>a boat-shaped open-faced bread that is filled with cheese, 
        butter, and a raw egg.</em></p>
    <p>The dough for Adjarian khachapuri is typically made with wheat flour, 
        water, yeast, and salt. After it has risen, the dough is shaped into 
        a boat-like form with raised edges. The filling is made with Georgian 
        cheese, typically sulguni or imeruli, which is mixed with butter 
        and a raw egg. The cheese mixture is then spooned into the center of 
        the dough and the edges are folded over to create a boat shape. 
        Just before baking, a raw egg is cracked into the center of 
        the cheese mixture.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, Adjarian khachapuri is eaten with a fork and knife, 
        and the butter and cheese mixture is mixed together with the raw egg 
        to create a delicious and satisfying meal. It is often served 
        as a breakfast food or as a snack, and is enjoyed throughout Georgia 
        and beyond.</p>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough from flour, milk, water, and yeast, then mix the salt 
            into the dough and grease it with oil. Knead the dough very well, 
            for about 5 minutes. Now, dust your hands with flour, and fold 
            the dough in on itself four times. Leave the dough to rise for 8 hours 
            at room temperature or for 24 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two balls, then cover them and let them rise 
            for 90 more minutes.</li>
        <li>When 90 minutes are up, put a pizza stone in the middle oven rack 
            and set the oven to preheat to maximum temperature.</li>
        <li>Grate the cheeses into one bowl, then add as much milk as necessary 
            to get a loose consistency.</li>
        <li>Shape each ball of dough into an oval using just your hands. 
            Fold over the longer sides of the oval, then seal them together 
            at the two narrow ends to get a „boat“ shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer the boats to a sheet of baking paper, then pull 
            the folded sides apart to reveal a cavity into which you need to 
            put the cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>An alternative way of shaping Adjaruli khachapuri is to first 
            put the cheese on the outer sides of the dough, then fold the dough 
            over to get a cheese-filled rim, then fill the center of the boat 
            with cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the baking paper with khachapuri on top of the pizza stone 
            and bake 10-12 minutes. However, depending on your oven, 
            the baking can take up to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the 8 minute mark, check the khachapuri, then place one egg 
            in the center of each. Bake for two more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, with a pat of butter on top.</li>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients (for 2 Servings)</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) milk, lukewarm</li>
        <li>approx. 50g (1.75 oz) water, depends on the flour</li>
        <li>4g (1 tsp) fresh yeast</li>
        <li>4g (1 tsp) salt</li>
        <li>8g (2 tsp) sunflower oil, for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g (10.5 oz) Imeruli cheese</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) sulguni</li>
        <li>1 egg, if needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough from flour, milk, water, and yeast. 
            Then, mix the salt into the dough and grease it with oil.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough very well, for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then, dust your hands with flour to prevent sticking, 
            and fold the dough in on itself four times.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough to rise for 8 hours at room temperature 
            or for 24 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>After eight hours have passed, make the filling. 
            Grate the cheese into one bowl, mix it, and see if you can shape 
            it into a ball. If it's falling apart, add a small amount of egg 
            to it to make it more compact.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a large circle by hand, place the cheese ball 
            in the center and fold the edges, so the cheese is sealed in.</li>
        <li>Turn over, and flatten first by hand, then with a rolling pin until 
            about 24 cm (10") in diameter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the pan, with the lid on top, for about 5 minutes on each side.</li>
    </ol>

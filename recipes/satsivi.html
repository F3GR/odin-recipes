            <li>1 teaspoon of ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground fenugreek</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (optional)</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="preparation">Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, add the chicken pieces and cover with water. 
                Bring it to a boil over medium heat and cook for about 20-25 minutes 
                until the chicken is fully cooked. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside to cool. 
                Reserve the chicken broth.</li>

            <li>In a food processor or blender, add the walnuts and pulse until finely ground. Set it aside.</li>

            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. 
                Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent and slightly golden, 
                about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and continue cooking for an additional minute.</li>

            <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the ground walnuts to the skillet. 
                Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic mixture.</li>

            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the ground coriander, 
                fenugreek, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne pepper, and salt. 
                Add this spice mixture to the skillet and stir to coat the walnut mixture evenly.</li>

            <li>Gradually pour in the chicken broth, stirring continuously to create a smooth sauce. 
                Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally,
                until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>

            <li>While the sauce is simmering, shred the cooled chicken into bite-sized pieces, 
                discarding the skin and bones.</li>

            <li>Add the shredded chicken to the sauce and stir well to coat each piece 
                with the walnut mixture. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to heat the chicken through.</li>

            <li>Remove the satsivi from the heat and stir in the white wine vinegar. 
                Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, if needed.</li>

            <li>Serve on a dish with fresh cilantro or parsley. Bon appetit!</li>
